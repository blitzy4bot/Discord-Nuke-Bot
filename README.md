# Discord-Nuke-Bot
A little Discord.py bot script. Please do NOT use it to RAID/NUKE public servers! The bot was made for personal fun and testing around with your OWN servers!

Version of Python used and tested: Python 3.10.7

### How to make it work? ###
    
    > Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new application ("New Application")
    > Add Bot
    > enable all "intents" on your bots dashboard (IMPORTANT)
    > copy your bot "token" and replace it with YOUR-TOKEN in the last line of the Python script (Dont share it with anyone)
    > Head over to "OAuth2" and click on "URL Generator". Tick "bot" and "Administrator" and invite the bot to your server using the generated link
    
    First run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" (Installs the required modules)
    Finally run Bot.py or GUI.py (requires to have Python installed)
