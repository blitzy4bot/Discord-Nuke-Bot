# Discord-Nuke-Bot
A little Discord.py bot script. Please do NOT use it to RAID/NUKE public servers! The bot was made for personal fun and testing around with your OWN servers!


### How to make it work? ###
    
    > Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new application ("New Application")
    > Add Bot
    > enable all "intents" on your bots dashboard (IMPORTANT)
    > copy your bot "token" and replace it with YOUR-TOKEN in the last line of the Python script (Dont share it with anyone)
    > Head over to "OAuth2" and click on "URL Generator". Tick "bot" and "Administrator" and invite the bot to your server using the generated link
    
    Finally run DiscordBot.py (requires to have Python installed)
